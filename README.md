# Take-Me-theCampusGuide
This is an Directions Application for JC Bose University Campus 


Problem Statement :- So When we move to a new workplace or Campus like Colleges , Universities or even Offices we find trouble initially in finding places in the Campus . So the same happened with me and others whose 2 semesters had been online and we had to appear for end semester exams in offline mode for the first time and were not aware of campus yet .
So on the day of the first exam everyone was clueless about their venues.
So taking motivation from this problem I built a Directions Telling Application for our University Campus.

Tech & Algo Used :-
Routing Algorithms used are Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path finding and A* Heuristic 

For authentication I have used firebase , for database used Cloud Firestore 

The application is in Java uses XML for front - end 

Adopted MVC pattern for design of the system 

Functionalities :- 
Users can choose or search their start / current location from the drop down spinner list 
Similarly they can choose the destination point and are shown the directions based on optimal-path .
