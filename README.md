This is an Directions Application for JC Bose University Campus 


Problem Statement :- So When we move to a new workplace or Campus like Colleges , Universities or even Offices we find trouble initially in finding places in the Campus. So taking motivation from this problem and as I was trying my hands on Android Development in Java I built a Directions Telling Application for our University Campus.

Tech & Algo Used :-
Routing Algorithms used Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path finding and A* Heuristic 

For authentication I have used firebase , for database used Cloud Firestore 

The application is in Java uses XML for front - end 

Adopted MVC pattern to  design the modules

Functionalities :- 
Users can choose or search their start / current location from the drop down spinner list 
Similarly they can choose the destination point and are shown the directions based on optimal-path .
